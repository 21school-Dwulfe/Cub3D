# Cub3D

### Just "make" and go!

This is a group project that we did together with [Dwulfe](https://github.com/21school-Dwulfe)

Use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable me to improve my skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical appli- cations of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.

I used the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating system, or from its sources.

Bonus list:

• Wall collisions.

• A minimap system.

• animated sprite.

• Rotate the point of view with the mouse.
